Lung Sound Analyzing app. Using low pass, high pass and sound enhancement filtering algorithms for analyzing lung sounds. 

The developed application is a tool that helps doctors analyze lung sounds
by listening. The application includes three buttons Upload Sound, Enhance Sound
and Filter Sound on a single screen and an audio signal visualizer called Sound
Visualizer. The desired sound is uploaded with the Upload Sound button and Sound
Visualizer displays the sound signals on the screen. The Enhance Sound button
amplifies the loaded audio signals for better analysis and displays the visual of the
amplified audio signals on the screen. The Filter Sound button reduces the pollution
of the loaded sound and cleans the sounds considered as noise. After the Filter Sound
button is applied, the audio frequency visual is updated according to the final state of
the audio. This application offers doctors an effective tool by combining many
processes used in the analysis of lung sounds into one platform.
